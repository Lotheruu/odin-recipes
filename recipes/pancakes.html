        Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or breakfast meal prep.
        The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious!
        This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.
